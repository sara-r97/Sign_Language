# **SIGN LANGUAGE**
### Interactive Graphics Final Project

# Introduction

### There are about 83.000.000 deaf people in the world but only a few non-deaf people know sign language. These people comunicate with their hands and arms. A single hand is used only to express the name and sourname by spelling it. All other words are associated with a gesture that is performed whit the use of both hands and arms. 
### Therefore, this project is the start point for a more complex and sofisticated work. In the future I will amplify this work adding a bust whit arms and hands and make a complete oral-sign dictionary.

### During the execution the color of the fingers will change: 
* ### Blue if the hand is showing the name 
* ### Purple if the hand is showing the surname

# The languages 

### I choose to use two different languages: 
 * ### American. It is the most common.
 * ### Italian. I live in Italy. 

### Before o during the execution it is possible to change the language using a button.
